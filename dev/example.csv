Parameter,Initial Value(s),Lower Bound(s),Upper Bound(s),Scaling,Design Variable(s)?,Description,
,,,,,,,
# Scalar Parameters,,,,,,,
scalar1,0,-Inf,Inf,1,false,this variable has all fields filled in,
scalar2,0,,,,,"this variable has almost no fields filled in, but is identical to scalar1",
scalar3,0,-Inf,Inf,1,true,"this variable is the same as scalar1, but is activated",
scalar4,250,100,1000,0.002,true,this variable is scaled to be roughly of order 1,
scalar5,10,,,,,"variables don't have to be design variables, they can also just be parameters",
scalar6,-1,,,,FALSE,note that the case doesn't matter for the design variable flag,
,,,,,,,
# Vector Parameters,,,,,,,
vector1,"[1, 2, 8, 9]",0,10,1,TRUE,this is an example of a vector parameter,
vector2,"[1, 2, 8, 9]","[0,0,5,5]","[5,5,10,10]","[1,1,0.5,0.5]",TRUE,scalars and/or vectors can be used for any field,
vector3,"[1, 2, 8, 9]","[0,0,5,5]","[5,5,10,10]","[1,1,0.5,0.5]","[true, false, true, false]",we can even use only part of an array as a design variable,
vector4,0.5*ones(10),zeros(10),1,ones(10)*0.5,TRUE,all values can also be input as generic Julia code,
,,,,,,,
# Matrix Parameters,,,,,,,
matrix1,[1 3; 2 4],0,10,1,true,the shape of vectors and matrices will be preserved,
,,,,,,,
# Other Parameters,,,,,,,
bool1,true,,,,,we can also include other types of variables as design parameters,
int1,1,,,,,integers will be converted to floats when used as design variables, but otherwise left as integers
string1,"""foo""",,,,,some types of variables like strings cannot be design variables,
