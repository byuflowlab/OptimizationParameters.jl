# Scalar Parameters,,,,,,,
scalar1,0.2422594009958947,-Inf,Inf,1,true,this variable has all fields filled in,
scalar2,0,,,,,"this variable has almost no fields filled in, but is identical to scalar1",
scalar3,0.9874782257596306,-Inf,Inf,1,true,"this variable is the same as scalar1, but is activated",
scalar4,-212.84436302815828,100.0,1000.0,0.002,true,this variable is scaled to be roughly of order 1,
scalar5,10,,,,,"variables don't have to be design variables, they can also just be parameters",
scalar6,-1,,,,FALSE,note that the case doesn't matter for the design variable flag,
